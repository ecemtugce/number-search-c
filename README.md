# number-search-c
This C program checks for the presence of a specific number within an array, counts how many times it repeats, and lists its positions (indices) within the array.
This program allows the user to enter as many numbers as they want until they input 0 to stop. Then, it asks for a number to search within the entered numbers and prints how many times the number occurs along with the indices where it appears.

Features
The user can enter numbers until they enter 0 to finish.

The program searches for a specified number among the entered numbers.

If the number is found, it shows how many times it appears and its indices.

If the number is not found, it prints "number not found".

Usage
Run the program.

Enter as many integers as you like (enter 0 to finish).

The program will display the count and indices of the searched number.
